You may have to adjust the compile line in the Makefile, different distributions need slightly different compile options, and it seems to change with each release.

In particular some systems may need -L/usr/lib/mysql added to the LDFLAGS line

Also in the program select4.c the structure MYSQL_FIELD has changed from older releases. From MySQL version 4 the length member has become an unsigned long.
