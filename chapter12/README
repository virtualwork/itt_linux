POSIX Threads.


thread1.c  -  a simple program using threads.

thread2.c  -  a program that executes 2 threads simultaneously.  You may have to wait a few seconds before
this program produces output.

thread3.c  -  a program that synchronizes threads using seamphores.

thread3a.c  -  a modified version of thread4.c.

thread4.c  -  a program that synchronizes threads using mutexes.

thread5.c  -  a program that sets a thread's detached state attribute.

If the output from thread1.c is less than 199506, then the following programs are particularly likely not to
compile.

thread6.c, thread7a.c  -  two programs that set a thread's scheduling attribute.

thread7.c  -  a program that cancels a thread.

thread8.c, thread8a.c  -  two programs that create many threads.
